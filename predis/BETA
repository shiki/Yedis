*** PLEASE READ ***

The library code in this branch is the result of a major rewrite of Predis 0.6 
and is considered of BETA quality, which means that there should not be any 
known outstanding bug and that the internal API is almost finalized and fixed 
(but it could still be subject to slight changes if needed).

Feedback is obviously appreciated and even if things should just work, use it 
at your own risk! If you need to use Predis in a production environment please 
use a tagged release or checkout the version-0.6 branch from the repository.
